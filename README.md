gitdoc
======


### Problems:

- Drupal is missing a tools like Github.com's Wiki
- Sync content dev > stage > prod is hard
- Better workflow for Drupal user (branching)

### Solution

Develop a new module, name it GitDoc, which provide a new entity type: GitDoc. Features are as same as Github's wiki, but integrate to Drupal system.

- Entity Access
- Sidebar/Header/Footer: Blocks
- Support Search API
- Support Rules

### Requirements

- Git wrapper library for PHP
- If there's already a GitWiki on PHP, that's great.
